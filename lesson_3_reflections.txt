When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You can create a remote repository to save copy of files. Some companies use git hub to store their local repositories.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may not want to have saved others commits on the GitHub into your own computer. If you want to get their commits, then its better to do it manually.
